Dear Princess Celestia, 

I said "Hello from FiMscript"!

Did you know that Derpy was "wall-eyed"?
I learned that Derpy Hooves's vision was "MUFFINS".

I learned to make friends.
I said "Making friends!".
Then you get "Friendship is Magic".
That's how to make friends.

I learned that somepony would make friends.
Then I get somepony.

Your faithful student,
Twilight Sparkle

console.log "Derpy is #{Derpy} and her vision is #{DerpyHooves.vision}"
console.log "When you make friends: #{result}"
